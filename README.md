# single-html-page

This website showcases my skills in HTML and CSS, and features a simple and clean design. In addition to the visual design, I've also focused on creating clean and semantic HTML code. I'm excited to continue learning and improving, and I hope you enjoy exploring this website as much as I enjoyed creating it.
